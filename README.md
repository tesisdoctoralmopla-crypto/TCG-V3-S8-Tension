# TCG-V3-S8-Tension: Supersonic Dark Energy Analysis

This repository contains the computational infrastructure and data analysis results for the paper "Supersonic Dark Energy: Strongly Reducing the S8 Tension via Supersonic Rigidity."

The project implements the **TCG V3** cosmological model, a modified gravity framework based on a **DBI-Galileon** field. This model introduces an effective sound speed **c_s^2 > 1** for the Dark Energy fluid, providing an intrinsic mechanism to suppress the growth of large-scale structure (LSS) at late times.

## Key Findings

* **Model Implementation:** Custom Boltzmann code modified to incorporate the DBI-Galileon Lagrangian and its perturbation equations.
* **Analysis:** Combined likelihoods from Planck CMB (Lite), Redshift Space Distortions (RSD) data, and Pantheon+ SNIa.
* **Detection:** Strong statistical evidence (**4.1σ preference**) for a non-zero Dark Energy sound speed parameter, **α_ss = 0.11 ± 0.02**.
* **Tension Resolution:** The best-fit parameter value shifts the derived clustering amplitude to **S8 = 0.801 ± 0.012**, achieving **1σ agreement** with LSS measurements.
* **Viability:** Causality is confirmed by explicit group velocity calculation (**c_group < 1**), and local safety is ensured by the **Vainshtein screening** mechanism.
* **Prediction:** The model predicts a measurable **6% suppression** of the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect at low multipoles (ℓ < 10).
